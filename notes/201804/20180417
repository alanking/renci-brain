Create a docker image with the following:

Install these:
    yum install -y epel-release
    yum -y update
    yum install -y sudo wget make gcc-c++ rpm-build git python-pip

    yum install -y python-pip
    yum install -y sudo
    yum install -y wget
    yum install -y make
    yum install -y gcc-c++
    yum install -y rpm-build

git clone these to /tmp:
    git clone https://github.com/irods/mungefs
    git clone https://github.com/irods/irods_python_ci_utilities

cd /tmp && yum install -y epel-release && yum -y update && yum install -y sudo wget make gcc-c++ rpm-build git python-pip && git clone https://github.com/jaking92/mungefs && git clone https://github.com/irods/irods_python_ci_utilities && pip install /tmp/irods_python_ci_utilities

pip install /tmp/irods_python_ci_utilities
Run mungefs build hook with --output_root_directory=/tmp/mungebld


cd /tmp 
yum install -y epel-release 
yum -y update 
yum install -y sudo wget make gcc-c++ rpm-build git python-pip 
git clone https://github.com/jaking92/mungefs 
git clone https://github.com/irods/irods_python_ci_utilities 
pip install /tmp/irods_python_ci_utilities



Created a Dockerfile that's really bad but at least it works... needs more variables



Idea: What if resc IDs were hashes instead of a number? Could allow for more resources.
    Size trade-off
