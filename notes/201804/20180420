How do we prefer to bring in changes linked to an issue that has already been closed?
    Milestones? Re-opening issue just to close it again?

baton-do demo

    Need example JSON input/command for baton-do
    ils -L of that collection to reproduce files of the same size
    Over federation to another catalog server
    What version of the replication plugin is being used? Where are the PIDs? Are different PIDs making the triples?
    Is baton-do holding a single connection to the server?
        It holds a single connection, so we would expect a single agent/PID on the server side to do all the operations.

Should we register all of the replicas at the start (0-length) and THEN start transfer?
    This would consolidate the code paths

Sanger logs were not particularly fruitful - the bug is not a failure, so nothing unusual in the log.


Being able to control the log level of the different plugins could be useful
    e.g. want debug logging in the replication/random resources, but not in core or authentication, etc.


What is the policy for resolving issues with other issues?
    Close and move milestone to match the duplicate? Mark as duplicate and close?
