Sanger bi-weekly:

[ ] 4.1.12 https://github.com/irods/irods/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A4.1.12
[ ] three files instead of two https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/3665
    Has been reproduced. Can only be done with concurrent writes.
    Why is Sanger seeing this 30% of the time?
    Probably resolved with --wlock in baton-put. Doesn't address root issue
    Possible for adding more logging to debug.
    Let's try more than 2 concurrent puts at a time in the script:
        There are TWELVE concurrent connections at the moment for Sanger - could be higher (32?) but is currently scaled down(?)
[ ] rebalance visibility https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/3683
[ ] status of no valid resc found on archive zone https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/3841
[ ] PING causing logging https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/3880
[ ] HA failures on iput (from my recent email)
[ ] discussions on a proposal of using resources outside of compound resources on zone



Found out that the reason localhost wasn't working for the .input file for 4.1.x setup was because of md5 authentication needed where peer authentication was being used when accessing postgres
Just changed /etc/postgresql/.../pg_hba.conf line


Maybe lift some of Andrew's tests but ehhhh
