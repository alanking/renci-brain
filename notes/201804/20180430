First day as permanent - yay

3904 and 3909 seem to be... mostly done. Running through CI.


Working on increased logging for Sanger.
    Need IP/hostname of initiating client
    What is being replicated
    Where it is being replicated to
    When it started

    Need configuration option so that this can be dialed down
    
Looks like we need a general logging enhancement which will include additional information in the logging
This should not be specific to the replication resource, but will be heavily utilized there to track movement of data through the resource
    extra replicas should show that another replication is occurring
    If we can show the host of the initiating client, we might be able to see if another actor is at play


Sanger says they only see extra replicas on the production environment
Is that true of any resource tree in the environment, or just those under root?
