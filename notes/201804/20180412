Assessing cmakelists for mungefs


iput -R does not error out when resource doesn't exist?



Could we get all the resource hierarchies that match the given data path and then see if any exist on the given hostname?
get_loc_for_hier_string
No, this is server-side only.


iquest still seems to return a result, so what's so special about it...?
Can we make iscan do the same thing?
    Yes, need to use R_RESC_MAIN instead of R_DATA_MAIN



TODO: Look into writing tests for ifsck

Fixed iscan, but need to clean up the code.
    3 nested for loops
    2-3 vectors of strings
    2 very similar functions
    Needs more references and const
    Code paths are repeated (maybe dead?)
    Needs more tests
    Needs tests on topology

Possible iscan enhancement: relative paths (need to convert to fullpath in the code since data_path is registered as such)
