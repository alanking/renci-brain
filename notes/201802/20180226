procApiRequest retry:
    if ( parallel ) {
        return error // side effect: orphaned remote agents
    }
    if ( connection failed ) {
        reconnect and try on different socket
    }
    else {
        try again on same socket
    }

This could be:

    if ( parallel ) {
        return error
    }

    if ( connection failed ) {
        reconnect (use different socket on conn)
    }

    try again with conn (could have different or same socket)
