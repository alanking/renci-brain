Once CI/VM configs are fixed, run build hook through Jenkins

If you run iput on a resource that does not exist, it produces a silent failure


chlrollback in the data object replication
if this were to run on a resource, would probably be fine, but since running from icat, we hit the failure
before  bailing from the failure, it's not cleaning up the statement table
    look for options in genquery
    
figure out which statements are getting leaked (if any)
    Bumping up the max number of statements seems to fix the issue
    ...but why is it getting overloaded in the first place??
