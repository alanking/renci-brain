All the notes from roguespace have been lost :(

mungefs requires irods-externals-* and irods-dev in order to build
mungefs implements a FUSE filesystem
./mungefs </path/to/mountpoint> -omodules=subdir,subdir=</target/directory> -oallow_other
    text in <> should be replaced with your inputs; the rest is literal
    Not sure if -oallow_other is needed, but I needed it to get this to work at first
    The -oallow_other flag may require root
See https://github.com/irods/mungefs for more info on using this


Now, we need to see if the verification step will help in the replication process while mungefs is dorking around with stuff

help@renci.org to request a name
    > we want roguespace.europa.renci.org


TriRODS - storage tiering capability

capture majority of use cases
packaged and versioned
configurations, not code
storage tiering capability is driven by metadata in the root resource above different... storage tiers
    attribute identifies group participant
    value defines group name
    unit defines position within the group
also have time constraints which can be configured with a different attribute (metadata)
another configuration for verification run against the destination replica via filestat and comparing file sizes
    verifying checksum will trigger a checksum calculation if none is present
