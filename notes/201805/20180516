Looking into 3853

Look at preinst and see if there's not a way to upgrade a non-package install.... /var/lib/irods is hard-coded in the script


Database has R_RESC_MAIN and R_DATA_MAIN
R_RESC_MAIN stores information about resources and only resources
    COL_R_RESC_NAME resides here to identify all the resources which have rows
R_DATA_MAIN stores information about all the data objects
    COL_D_RESC_NAME resides here to identify the resource name associated with the data object
    COL_D_RESC_HIER resides here to identify the resource hierarchy associated with the data object



sudo su - postgres
psql
\c ICAT irods
<testpassword>
\dt # list tables
select * from r_data_main;
    list everything in r_data_main



Will need a VM with 4.1.x installed. Will need to be able to install built packages (and/or build packages) for upgrade to 4.2.x to see if the columns are blanked out.


That's step 1. Next we need to explicitly write out blanks whenever we write to r_data_main to ensure that no values remain...
