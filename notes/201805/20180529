    totally works

Notes on automated ingest slides:

    Every slide seems to have an invisible box which links to... these slides. Which is weird.
        Actually, it's really annoying. Dunno if it's just slides.com

    Slide 5:
        Add -y to install commands
        pip3 requires python3-pip
            Also, we use both pip and pip3... differences? consistency possible?
        virtualenv needed but not installed
        
    Slide 7:
        text is horribly mangled
        Unclear which window we are supposed to be in (probably the original one?)

    Slide 8:
        text box covers up bottom word
        need to pip install structlog

    slide 9:

Slide 34/41:
    Make the text on bottom same color so it's clear that it's one command
        
Main takeaway: Need to decide if we want python3/pip3, python2/pip2, or python/pip
Only tested stuff with python3/pip3.
