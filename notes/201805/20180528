Think I might have found the shmem culprit...  test_writeLine_config_first_3477 and  test_writeLine_config_last_3477

These tests inesrt the native REP before and after the python REP, respectively, and then execute a native rule. Not sure how that works for python, but apparently it does.
Anyway, the shared memory instance is instantiated outright in these tests, so maybe these are the only ones that need to be skipped?
Let's try a build where we ONLY skip these tests for python REP. This could eliminate the need to skip anything else.
    Nevermind, you need to skip the ones that python REP does not support. Afterall, that's why we are doing it in the first place. The issue comes in with the rearranging.
    So try removing the rearranging and just add the extra skips and/or server bounces to ensure that the shmem is destroyed.

The problem seems to be that the shmem is instatiated via the configuration of
