irods_resource_redirect
irods_resolve_resource_hierarchy
    calls file_object_factory()

Not?
    Factory Method Pattern

Simple Factory Pattern
    file_object_factory() == factory method in file_object
    resolve_resource_hierarchy calls file_object_factory to create an object
    So file_object is the Product and the Factory is just the method - no object involved
