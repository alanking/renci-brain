When using the updateRepl= keyword, it is expected that missing replicas, not just stale replicas, are updated.

This was noticed after a replica under a replication resource was trimmed within a rule, and then tried to be overwritten or appended - with no effect. There remained only a single replica.

This was reproduced with itrim and irepl -U from the command line.






So is the idea that the physical file is missing? Updating a replica that has been removed from iRODS is impossible.
i.e. how can we know if a replica is supposed to exist if it's not in the catalog?

So this must refer to missing physical files




...no, it has to do with replication resource

Also, is this the same issue as not being able to irepl to a replication resource?
It's not replicating the write operation, but this sure seems like the same issue...
