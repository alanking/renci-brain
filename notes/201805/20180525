Make a parallel set of branches/versions for CI so that 4.1/4.2/4.3/5.0 can be separated?

Put it in git, at any rate.

s = skip native rule language REP tests
r = rearrange tests to avoid test_re_shm failure

        !s&&!r      s&&!r       !s&&r       s&&r
BaB     yes         yes         no          no
PREP    no          no          no          yes???
