            Wow, we have a javascript REP... cooooool

            There's also apparently a Go REP... not documented.
                Could add that for style points at least
                GoRODS

            Page 24:
            In iRODS version 4.3, the iRODS team hopes to add pluggable data transport as the eighth plugin
            interface. This will allow hardware vendors to maximize the connections between their machines.
            iRODS will serve only as the broker for the fast connection.

                Is this true?
                It's not true! Take it out.

            ROUND ROBIN!!!
                Torch it.


page 3 vs. page 26
    Exact same explanation of storage resources. Needed?
    Seems more appropriate on 26 - maybe link to 26 from 3


            page 27:
            For example, the Replication Coordinating Resource weights a vote from a storage resource more
            heavily if it possesses a local copy. The replication coordinating resource is designed to honor “locality
            of reference,” and then point the client to the closest data.

                My understanding was that the unixfilesystem resource made that determination...

page 28:
            Minor note: seeing the tree displays the --ascii version of ilsresc

Adding new storage: starts off talking about rebalance, but there are no files in rods
    Might help to do an ils to show the effect:
        ils -L /tempZone/home/alice/training_jpgs

Nitpick: You can tell somebody else started writing here because there are suddenly citations :)

            Links on the text? What does it do?
            Clicked it and it spins for a while and then does nothing
            Oh, it's downloading files. Maybe put a comment referring to the fact that we want to download or copy the contents to a file.

            ’ is used instead of ' and this was causing me to have errors.

            Gave me a lot more stuff than in the example. I think python-exif has been updated
