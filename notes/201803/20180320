Spent most of the day on the numeric_cast issue -_-
Created test for exceedingly large value of delay in seconds

Started #3848

Fails as expected (too many replicas)
The tree looks like this:

repl
|____unixA
|____random
     |____unixB1
     |____unixB2

Expecting 2 replicas, but we get 3
Replica from first put is stale, but the other two have '&'
