hierarchy_parser appears to be the way to iterate over the list of children...?

for ( resc_list_t::const_iterator itr = resc_list_.begin(); !result && itr != resc_list_.end(); ++itr )

So we want to confirm that there are no replicas registered in the catalog...
But why can't we just assume that it exists based on the data object creation logic?
What exactly does Jason mean by "no replica registered in the catalog"? A newly created data object? Or just that there are no replicas/COPIES? 
Looks like we will need to generate a query like the following?

select DATA_ID where DATA_RESC_HIER like <resc_hier> || <resc_hier> || ... for all leaves

And if anything comes back, then we're good...?


Remove child that's not there and it doesn't complain???
