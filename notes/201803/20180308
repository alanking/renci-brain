justin, how do i fetch a file out of wos with curl?
i need the stat and fetch curl commands if you have them

To fetch a file it is the get command.
curl -v -H "x-ddn-oid: lDkFvoTfBiLw3eCt3pF9FVT9NOIVJV1O2DK2L28F" "http://ddn-wos6000.irods.renci.org/cmd/get"
For the stat, the code does the first version of the GET without being verbose.  They specify no headers but then read the x-ddn-status so I'm not sure about that. 

Anyway, I think this is close to what the code is doing.
curl -sD - -o "content-type: application/octet-stream" -H "content-length: 0" "http://ddn-wos6000.irods.renci.org/objects/lDkFvoTfBiLw3eCt3pF9FVT9NOIVJV1O2DK2L28F"

Sorry, mistake there.
$ curl -sD - -o /dev/null -H "content-type: application/octet-stream" -H "content-length: 0" "http://ddn-wos6000.irods.renci.org/objects/lDkFvoTfBiLw3eCt3pF9FVT9NOIVJV1O2DK2L28F"
