bundle extract is not taking the same path as put for registering files
The data mode appears to be missing from the data object information
iput get the data mode on file creation from the rcDataObjCreateAndStat



regUnbunSubfiles


ibun can be done in bulk, so make sure to account for that path too
    > bulk path is already including dataMode...
    > Write tests for it anyway


Okay, fixed Bob's issue. That was fun

Back to #3848

iput -f will only update a single replica (and the others lose their &)
    On testing this, I do not agree with this assertion.

EXPECTATION:
    If the user does an iput -f into the repl resc and tehre is no replica registered in the catalog, then we should not replicate
    Leaf bundles are needed to look for replicas in the tree
