skip_replication_on_overwrite -> skip_create_new_replica_on_overwrite


Client 1 runs iput with large file to path "testfile" -> t1
Client 2 runs iput with small file to path "testfile" -> t2

t1.start
    iput completes, replication begins
    1 or more replications complete
t2.start
    overwrites all the existing replicas and stops
    the rest of the replication fails for t1 and it exits with sys_copy_len_err on whatever file it was repl'ing
    This is probably because writing to the same place at the same time and then the catalog entry no longer matches


t1.start
    iput starts, empty file in catalog
    transfer begins
t2.start
    writes to the logical path with the smaller file, updates catalog and exits
    t1 fails because catalog no longer matches what is being transferred
